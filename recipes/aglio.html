        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This late-night Roman staple is astonishingly full-flavored. Start the water before you do anything else, because the sauce takes less than 10 minutes start to finish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Dried red chile flakes</li>
            <li>1 large head of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley, chopped </li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>Spaghetti pasta</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into 1/4-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.</p></li>
        </ol>
