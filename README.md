This is Day 2 (9/17/21) of TOP: Foundations! With this first project I hope to demonstrate my understanding of HTML basics. Cheers!
Note: The content found on these recipe pages is borrowed from NYT Cooking for my personal project. I did not create the images or write the text, these are just my favorite recipes!
